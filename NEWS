v0.5

`parentElement` argument added to all d3Network functions. It allows the user 
to specify the resulting svg graph's parent element. This is esspecially handy 
for use with Shiny server. Thanks to John Harrison.

Minor documentation improvements.

Internal code cleaning.

v0.4.2 

Minor bug fix for `d3ForceNetwork`.

v0.4.1

Improve `d3ForceNetwork` documentation.

v0.4 

Added `d3Sankey` to create Sankey diagrams. Thanks to Scott Chamberlain for the 
suggestion. 

v0.3.3

`toJSONarray` no longer quotes integers. Thanks to Mark Gene.

v0.3.2

Change examples for `d3ClusterDendro` so that they run on Windows.

v0.3.1 

Collapse and expand clustered dendrograms.

Mouse over zooming with clustered dendrograms.

v0.3

Added Reingold–Tilford Tree graph with `d3Tree`.

Added Cluster Denograms with `d3ClusterDendro`.

v0.2.1

Added ability to zoom into and out of graphs with `zoom` option for 
`d3ForceNetwork`.

`d3ForceNetwork` example now uses tabular data. 

v0.2

Added `d3ForceNetwork` for creating force directed network graphs where link 
distance and group changes the graphs attributes.

`d3SimpleNetwork` and `d3Network` are now the same and have improved aesthetic 
customisability. `d3Network` is depricated. This is in advance of creating 
functions for force directed and other types of networks.

`JSONtoDF` command added for reading a JSON data file into R. It converts a 
specified array in the JSON data  into a data frame.

Improvements to the internal workings of the commands. Now uses mustache 
templates to create the graphs.

Documentation and minor bug fixes.

v0.1.2

Internal improvements using whisker templating.
